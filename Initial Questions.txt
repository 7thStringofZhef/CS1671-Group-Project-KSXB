1. Use the data to find out propensities of customers in certain cities or areas. (for example, people in south part of city A prefer the restaurants with better prices, while people in north part of city A prefer restaurants with better decoration/services) The analysis could be useful reference for restaurant owners.

2. Can we predict which cities or areas have the best quality of certain types of food/restaurants based on review data? What about the worst quality (there are plenty of surveys/ top ten lists on where to eat in a given area, what about where not to eat)? 

3. Use the Yelp data pertaining to restaurant reviews in an attempt to predict other restaurant reviews for a given user. We could also look into finding users with similar interests (such as style of restaurant, specific cuisine,  etc).
- More info: I did a similar project with Netflix review data where we attempted to predict user reviews for movies that they had not yet reviewed based on their data as well as all other user review data. The project also attempted to find users with similar tastes/interests (so find user similarity). We used various techniques in this project such as: Kendall Tau/Spearman Coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, Cosine similarity, and Slop One. I would like to try to replicate this idea in our term project to see if we can generate the same/similar results using techniques discussed in lecture (language modeling, text classification, etc).
